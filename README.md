# advent-of-code-2020

This repositoty is the result of me learning Rust by solving advent of code challenges every day in December 2020.
My main focus was on creating clean and readable rust code and learning the idioms of the language.

## Usage

Each day is separated into its own branch containing input and examples.
The point where part 1 is solved is clearly marked in the commit history.
The solutions are usually run through `cargo run <arguments>`, passing the path to the input file or parameters as arguments (should be obvious from the source).
